# Archive Directory

This directory contains completed AI plan files for closed/merged issues.

Plan files are automatically archived here when:
1. A PR is merged (via `upload-ai-plan.yml` workflow)
2. Manual archival using: `mv .aiplans/ISSUE-X.md .aiplans/archive/ISSUE-X-YYYYMMDD.md`

## Naming Convention
`ISSUE-<number>-<YYYYMMDD>.md`

Example: `ISSUE-42-20251006.md`

## Retention Policy
- Keep archived plans for audit and reference purposes
- Review archived plans before sharing externally (may contain internal notes)
- Consider cleaning up plans older than 1 year
