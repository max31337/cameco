/**
 * LeaveRequestController
 *
 * Handles all leave request operations for the HR Leave Management module.
 *
 * WORKFLOW OVERVIEW:
 * ==================
 * This controller manages the complete leave request lifecycle as submitted by employees
 * through HR staff. All leave requests originate from employee input (either direct submission
 * or HR staff entering requests on their behalf) and flow through the following stages:
 *
 * 1. SUBMISSION (HR Input)
 *    - HR Staff receives leave request from employee (verbal, form, or system submission)
 *    - HR Staff validates employee's leave balance and dates
 *    - HR Staff creates/submits leave request in system
 *    - System generates initial notification
 *
 * 2. APPROVAL WORKFLOW
 *    - Request routed to Immediate Supervisor for first-level approval
 *    - Supervisor reviews request with comments
 *    - If rejected: goes back to employee with rejection reason via HR
 *    - If approved: forwarded to HR Manager for final approval
 *    - HR Manager reviews and makes final decision (approve/reject)
 *
 * 3. PROCESSING (by HR)
 *    - HR Staff processes approved requests
 *    - Leave balance is deducted from employee's annual allocation
 *    - Leave slip/document is generated
 *    - Employee is notified of approval status
 *    - Record is filed in employee's personnel file
 *
 * 4. COMPLETION
 *    - Employee takes approved leave
 *    - HR tracks dates and ensures DTR alignment (via Timekeeping module)
 *    - Leave request is marked as completed
 *    - Annual audit shows in employee's leave record
 *
 * KEY POINTS:
 * - All requests originate from EMPLOYEE INPUT (either submitted directly or via HR staff)
 * - HR STAFF is the central coordinator/processor of all leave requests
 * - Supervisors and HR Manager approve, but HR staff executes the processing
 * - Employees do NOT have direct system access; HR staff acts as intermediary
 * - System tracks full audit trail of all approvals and HR actions
