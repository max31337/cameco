# HR & Payroll Configuration

## Purpose
Document HR Manager and HR Staff responsibilities for payroll configuration, salary rates, departmental pay structures, payroll periods, and deduction management. Covers permissions and approval hierarchy.

## Permissions overview
- HR Manager: full access to HR and Payroll configuration for the organization (salary rates, components, approval flows).
- HR Staff: create/edit employee records, assist in payroll data entry, cannot change master salary components or approval rules.

## Salary rate configuration
1. Salary components (master): basic, allowances, overtime, bonuses, statutory deductions, taxes.
2. Component settings: calculation method (fixed, percentage_of_basic, per_hour), taxable flag, frequency.
3. HR Manager can create/edit components; changes are versioned and logged.

## Departmental pay structure management
- Define pay scales per department and position. Each department has pay bands with min/median/max.
- Assign default salary components per department to simplify onboarding and imports.

## Payroll period setup
- Payroll period types: weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, monthly.
- HR Manager sets default pay period for organization; Admin can change organization-wide settings.

## Deductions and allowance management
- Configure statutory deductions (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG) with rate tables maintained by Admin/Superadmin (global overrides possible).
- Configure custom deductions and allowances with effective dates.

## Payroll approval hierarchy
1. Draft payroll generated by HR (calculations + validations).
2. HR Manager reviews and forwards to Admin for approval (if Admin approval required by org policy).
3. Admin approves; for high-risk actions (mass adjustments, reverse payments), Superadmin approval may be required.

## Integration points
- Timekeeping: attendance, overtime hours feed into payroll calculations.
- HR: employee records, government IDs, bank information.
- Onboarding: initial salary assignment and contract details.

## First-time setup tasks for HR Manager
- [ ] Create salary components and default values
- [ ] Configure departmental pay bands
- [ ] Configure deduction tables and statutory placeholders
- [ ] Create approval workflows and notification recipients

## Audit & safeties
- All payroll changes versioned with before/after snapshots.
- Sensitive fields (bank_account, tin) require elevated permission to view; access logged.

## Acceptance criteria
- HR Manager can configure salary components and departmental pay scales.
- Payroll calculation flow integrates attendance and deductions and supports multi-level approval.
