# HR Module - Architecture & Implementation Plan

## Module Overview
The HR Module is the **foundation module** of the SyncingSteel System, providing comprehensive employee management capabilities for Cathay Metal Corporation. This module establishes the core employee data structure that will be used by Timekeeping and all modules.

**Employee Access Policy:**
> **Currently, employees (non-HR) have no direct access to the system.** All requests, updates, and information must go through HR staff, who act as the sole interface between employees and the HRIS. Employees do not log in, view, or update their own records.

> **Future Option:** The system is designed to allow for an employee self-service portal in the future, enabling employees to view payslips, request leave, and update personal information directly if enabled by management.

### Admin Self-Onboarding Workflow (System Startup)
1. **Admin registers user account** (`user.employee_id = NULL`)
2. **System detects unlinked admin** (on first login after registration approval)
3. **Display self-onboarding prompt** ("Complete your employee profile to continue")
4. **Admin fills employee creation form** (own personal/employment details)
5. **System creates employee record** (`employees.user_id = admin_user.id`)
6. **Auto-link user to employee** (`user.employee_id = new_employee.id`)
7. **Admin can now access full HR module** (manage other employees)

### Employee Onboarding Workflow (Normal Operation)
1. **HR creates employee record** (basic info)
2. **Complete employee profile** (personal, government IDs, family)
3. **Generate employment contract** (auto-populated from template)
4. **Create system user account** (optional, for self-service access)
5. **Set initial leave balances** (per company policy)
6. **Send welcome notification** (email with system access details)ll modules.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ User authentication and approval system
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control foundation
- ‚úÖ Basic department structure planning
- üîÑ **Ready for HR module implementation**

## User-Employee Relationship Strategy

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Design Decision:** The system handles the "empty system" startup scenario through flexible user-employee relationships with special admin workflow.

**Problem Solved:** 
- System starts with no employee records
- Admin needs to bootstrap themselves as both user and employee
- Users can register before employee records exist
- Admin needs to manage both user accounts and employee data

**Architecture Solution:**
- **`users.employee_id`** ‚Üí **NULLABLE** (users can exist without employee records)
- **`employees.user_id`** ‚Üí **NULLABLE** (employee records can exist without system access)
- **Bidirectional optional relationship** enables flexible linking when needed

## Complete User-Employee Workflow Scenarios

### 1. Admin Bootstrapping (System Startup)
```
System Start ‚Üí Admin Registration ‚Üí First Login ‚Üí Self-Onboarding Prompt
                     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì
            user.employee_id = NULL  Dashboard shows   Admin creates own
                                    "Complete Profile"  employee record
                                           ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
                                    Auto-link user.employee_id to new record
                                           ‚Üì
                                    Admin can now manage other employees
```

### 2. Employee Registration & Approval
```
Employee Registration ‚Üí Admin Review ‚Üí Link to Employee Record
         ‚Üì                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì
user.employee_id = NULL  Find existing OR  user.employee_id = employee.id
                        create new record   employee.user_id = user.id
```

### 3. System-Only Users (Special Cases)
```
External User Registration ‚Üí Admin Review ‚Üí Remain Unlinked
           ‚Üì                      ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  user.employee_id = NULL    No employee     user.employee_id = NULL
                            record needed    (consultant, external admin)
```

## Module Goals
1. **Employee Lifecycle Management**: Onboarding to archiving
2. **Leave Request Workflow**: Multi-level approval system
3. **Document Generation**: Contracts, slips, certificates
4. **Self-Service Portal**: Employee access to own records
5. **HR Analytics**: Reporting and insights
6. **Compliance**: Philippine labor law requirements
7. **Onboarding & Offboarding**: Clear handoffs from ATS to HR Core and onboarding task automation

## Database Schema (HR Module)


### Core Employee Tables

## HR Module Tables (see HR_MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md for full schema and details)
### employees
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    profile_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, -- Personal information lives in profiles; employees reference profiles
    employee_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

    -- Employment Information (keep employment-only fields here)
    department_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    position VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    employment_type ENUM('regular', 'contractual', 'probationary', 'consultant') NULL,
    date_employed DATE NULL,
    date_regularized DATE NULL,
    immediate_supervisor_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,

    -- System Fields
    status ENUM('active', 'archived', 'terminated', 'on_leave', 'suspended') DEFAULT 'active',
    termination_date DATE NULL,
    termination_reason TEXT NULL,
    created_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    updated_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL,

    INDEX idx_employees_user_id (user_id),
    INDEX idx_employees_profile_id (profile_id),
    INDEX idx_employees_employee_number (employee_number),
    INDEX idx_employees_department_id (department_id),
    INDEX idx_employees_supervisor_id (immediate_supervisor_id),
    INDEX idx_employees_status (status),
    INDEX idx_employees_employment_type (employment_type),

    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (profile_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (immediate_supervisor_id) REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (updated_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

Note: Employees do not store personal identity fields (name, DOB, contact, address). Those live in the profiles table. Link employees.profile_id to profiles.id. This separation allows a single person identity to be reused across modules (User Management, ATS) and keeps employment data isolated.

### government_ids

## Key Features & Workflows

### System Startup & Data Population Workflow
**Phase 1: Empty System Setup**
1. **Admin account created** (employee_id = null, no employee record needed)
2. **Admin accesses HR module** (begins populating employee master data)
3. **Employee records created** (user_id = null, no system accounts yet)

**Phase 2: User Registration & Linking**
1. **Employees self-register** (employee_id = null initially)
2. **Admin reviews registrations** (approval process with optional employee linking)
3. **Admin links user to employee record** (bidirectional relationship update)
4. **User gains employee-specific features** (self-service portal, leave requests)

### Employee Onboarding Workflow
1. **HR creates employee record** (basic info, user_id = null)
2. **Complete employee profile** (personal, government IDs, family)
3. **Generate employment contract** (auto-populated from template)
4. **Create/link system user account** (optional, for self-service access)
5. **Set initial leave balances** (per company policy)
6. **Send welcome notification** (email with system access details)

### Leave Request Workflow  
1. **Employee submits leave request** (via self-service or HR)
2. **System validates leave balance** (sufficient days available)
3. **Route to immediate supervisor** (auto-approval for certain types)
4. **Supervisor approves/rejects** (with comments if rejected)
5. **Update leave balance** (deduct approved days)
6. **Generate leave slip** (PDF for filing)
7. **Notify employee** (approval/rejection with document)

### Document Generation Workflow
1. **Select document template** (contract, certificate, etc.)
2. **Auto-populate employee data** (from database)
3. **Allow custom field editing** (specific dates, amounts, etc.)
4. **Generate PDF preview** (review before final generation)
5. **Save to document storage** (with audit trail)
6. **Email to employee** (optional distribution)
