# Timekeeping Module - Architecture & Implementation Plan

## Module Overview
The Timekeeping Module manages employee attendance, time tracking, and work schedule management for Cathay Metal Corporation. This module integrates with HR employee data and provides attendance information to the Payroll module for accurate salary calculations.

## Module Dependencies
- **HR Module**: Employee records, department structure
- **Foundation**: User management, roles, permissions
- ðŸ”„ **Provides data to**: Payroll Module (attendance for salary calculations)

## Module Goals
1. **Manual Time Entry**: Staff-assisted time recording system
2. **Import Management**: CSV/Excel timesheet processing
3. **Attendance Tracking**: Real-time attendance monitoring
4. **Schedule Management**: Shift schedules and overtime tracking
5. **Reporting**: Comprehensive attendance analytics
6. **Integration**: Seamless data flow to HR and Payroll modules
7. **Workforce Integration**: Consume `workforce_schedules` and reflect rotation assignments
8. **Appraisal Inputs**: Provide attendance quality metrics used by the Appraisal module for scoring and rehire recommendations

## Key Features & Workflows

### Manual Time Entry Workflow
1. **HR/Admin opens attendance entry** (daily attendance interface)
2. **Select employee and date** (search by name/employee number)
3. **Record time events** (time in, out, breaks, overtime)
4. **Validate against schedule** (flag late/undertime/overtime)
5. **Save attendance record** (create daily summary)
6. **Generate notifications** (alert for attendance issues)

### CSV/Excel Import Workflow
1. **Upload timesheet file** (validate format and size)
2. **Parse and preview data** (show import summary)
3. **Validate employee data** (match against HR records)
4. **Process import batch** (create attendance events)
5. **Handle errors and corrections** (flag invalid entries)
6. **Generate import report** (success/failure summary)
7. **Update daily summaries** (recalculate affected records)

### Daily Summary Calculation
1. **Retrieve attendance events** (for specific employee/date)
2. **Load work schedule** (get expected hours and breaks)
3. **Calculate time worked** (total hours minus breaks)
4. **Determine overtime** (hours over schedule threshold)
5. **Flag attendance issues** (late, undertime, missing records)
6. **Update summary record** (store calculated values)
7. **Trigger payroll notification** (if attendance affects pay)

### Overtime Request Workflow
1. **Employee/Supervisor submits request** (planned overtime)
2. **System validates schedule** (check conflicts and limits)
3. **Route for approval** (department manager approval)
4. **Track actual overtime** (compare planned vs actual)
5. **Update attendance summary** (include overtime hours)
6. **Generate overtime report** (for payroll processing)

- **Time Entry Grid**: Multiple employees, multiple time events
- **Schedule Reference**: Show expected vs actual times
- **Bulk Actions**: Apply same time to multiple employees
- **Department Filter**: Filter by Office, Production, or Security departments

### Import Management
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop with format validation
- **Import Preview**: Show parsed data before processing
- **Error Resolution**: Interface to fix import errors
- **Batch History**: Track all import operations

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Attendance Reports**: Daily, weekly, monthly summaries by department

## Import File Formats

### CSV Format for Attendance Import
```csv
Employee_Number,Date,Time_In,Time_Out,Break_Start,Break_End,Notes
EMP-2025-0001,2025-10-06,08:00,17:00,12:00,13:00,"Regular day"
EMP-2025-0002,2025-10-06,08:15,17:30,12:00,13:00,"Late arrival"
```

### Excel Template Structure
- **Sheet 1**: Attendance Data (same as CSV format)
- **Sheet 2**: Instructions and field definitions
- **Sheet 3**: Employee reference list (number, name, department)

### Data Validation Rules
- **Employee Number**: Must exist in HR module
- **Date**: Valid date format, not future date
- **Time Format**: HH:MM or HH:MM:SS format
- **Logical Validation**: Time out > Time in, Break end > Break start

---

## Integration Points

### HR Module Integration
- **Employee Data**: Read employee records, schedules, departments
- **Leave Requests**: Check for approved leaves to exclude from attendance
- **Department Structure**: Use for reporting and access control
- **User Permissions**: Respect HR-defined access levels

### Payroll Module Integration  
- **Attendance Export**: Provide calculated hours for payroll
- **Overtime Data**: Export overtime hours with rates
- **Leave Integration**: Coordinate paid/unpaid leave hours
- **Schedule Data**: Provide work schedule information

### Notification System
- **Missing Attendance**: Alert HR when employees miss time recording
- **Overtime Approvals**: Notify managers of pending overtime requests
- **Import Results**: Email import success/failure reports
- **Schedule Changes**: Notify affected employees of schedule updates

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Partitioning**: Partition attendance tables by month/year
- **Indexing**: Employee ID + Date for fast daily lookups
- **Archiving**: Move old attendance data to archive tables
- **Query Optimization**: Use summary tables for reporting

### Caching Strategy
- **Work Schedules**: Cache schedule data (updated rarely)
- **Daily Summaries**: Cache calculated attendance summaries
- **Employee Lists**: Cache active employee lists
- **Report Data**: Cache frequently accessed reports

### File Processing
- **Chunked Processing**: Process large imports in batches
- **Background Jobs**: Use Laravel queues for file processing
- **Memory Management**: Stream large files to avoid memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted files

---

## Security & Compliance

### Data Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: HR can view all, managers see department only
- **Audit Logging**: Track all attendance modifications
- **Time Correction Approval**: Require approval for time corrections
- **Data Retention**: Archive old attendance data per policy

### Import Security
- **File Validation**: Scan uploaded files for security threats
- **Size Limits**: Restrict file size to prevent DoS attacks
- **Format Verification**: Ensure only valid file formats accepted
- **Access Logging**: Log all import operations with user tracking

---
