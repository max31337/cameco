2. **Philippine Tax Compliance**: BIR, SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG calculations
3. **Payslip Generation**: Detailed payslips with all components
4. **Statutory Reporting**: Government-required reports and forms
5. **Payroll Analytics**: Cost analysis and budgeting reports
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete payroll processing history
